# Last Algorithms Course

This repository contains some notes and relevant `Java` implementations for
[ThePrimeagen's](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) course on FrontendMasters -
[The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).

The course's code is in Typescript, however, because Typescript isn't really relevant to me, I
decided to implement required problems in Java.

## Repository Structure

- [/src/docs/basics](/src/docs/basics) contains notes.
- [/src/main](/src/main) contains main implementations for course challenges.
- [/src/docs/basics](/src/docs/basics) contains tests that I came up with to test the
  implementations.
